## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Not sure if I am going to just do vanilla JS or use [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

* Always put a type on your ```<button>``` elements. 
* Make sure your alt descritions for images/icons used for an action say what the action does e.g. alt="bookmark" not alt="bookmark icon"
* Do not use ```<br/>``` because screen readers say break out loud and that is annoying
* do not use an empty div with a border to make decorative line. User borders on existing elements
* Use aria-expanded for menu toggle functions. Like a hamburger icon that toggles to a navigation menu 
* 


### Continued development

Having a hell of a time with the hover mouseover event that changes the hamburger nav icon into a nav list w/ links. I got the hover change to occur but the hamberger loses placement styling upon returning to UI.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
